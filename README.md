## Code:

Code for our project is found in the directories `data` and `site`.

##### `data/events`

This folder contains a list of key events that have happened during the presidential election that will be displayed on the second visualization. These were compiled manually; threre is no code to run.

##### `data/polls`

Running the script `get_huff_polls.sh` will download poll results from the Huffington Post Pollster API. The file `format.js` outputs the data in a useful format.

#### `data/search`

JSON and CSV files in this folder are output generated by Google Trends. The file `format.js` outputs the data in a useful format.
